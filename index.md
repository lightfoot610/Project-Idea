## Mobile Control for Solar/Battery Storage

![solar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48243224/54472570-28ea7080-4805-11e9-96b2-b402f7b9bd82.jpg)

The project idea i will work on is solar/battery storage for homes and properties and creating a general application for owners to control their power usage and went they want battery power or mains power used. There is already multiple solar apps that track solar consumption and KWh but all are poorly rated and don't give the owner much control. I wish to implement a control system in a homes switchboard that cuts out incoming power and uses only the power stored. 

### Motivation Towards This Project

Working in the electrical industry, nearly every home has solar panels and a inverter converting power back into the grid. Being from WA, our electricity provider (Western Power) use smart meters and tariffs to control the power consumption. All of clients ask whether there are ways to bypass the provider and use the power the solar panels generate. That only works if you have a  large battery group to store it. It is a expensive exercise especially for small homes but there are more and more trials being conducted around WA and it looks to be the way of the future to avoid black outs and use up to 90% of your usage straight from your solar.

### How will it work?

The features of my idea will involve a micro-processor controlled wiring system to control which power you would like to use and installing contactors, relays, automatic switches inside your switchboard. A lot of research will have come into consideration for this idea. The electrical side I have some understanding of, its the approach of how to attack the IT side of a project like this, that is the challenge. I have chosen C Bus technology to program to this output because it is a software I'm familar with. I have also chosen this beacuse I am unsure how to create an application at this stage but in the long run I believe creating a general app for all solar/battery systems would be most effective once i learn the necessary skills required.

The main functions i would want this idea to achieve is:

- Be able to change the incoming electrical source to your house from a device (Shutoff grid power and use solar)
- Automatic sensing to change mains power when battery power is too low and kick back in when sufficient enough
- Store data of power usage (kWh)
- Alerts and faults diagnostics

### Skills Required
In order to create a successful app, the required skills needed are:
- To be competent in coding (Java etc)
- Able to use Android SDK
- Creative design and writing skills
- Performance testing skills which will ensure the application is reliable and performing in accordance to there intended workload. 
- Cross platform skills which will assist in identifying any issues that may impact the performance of the application.

To connect control equipment into the switchboard or power source an electrician will be required.

### Overall
This idea is already in motion and i expect it will really pick up in the next few years after more successful trials. With everyone's home able to use their own power system there will be less reliablity on grid power and coal driven generators. This application gives the owner control of which power system is being used, information of PV panel performance, overall usage, safety precautions and automatic changeover if battery power is low. Solar energy is a eco friendly source of energy and the future of power usage. Therefore I believe its an important project to put research into and I can see myself wanting the be apart of more as I expand my knowledge in the IT industry.
